### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an English<=>Polish translator, EFL trainer, enthusiastic and aspiring junior programmer. I help IT people speak their mind in English, make documentation readable to users as well as business, and make sure that terminology is a tool for communication rather than gatekeeping.

Here I'm having fun participating in a Python bootcamp. 

I have another account geared more towards linguistics/ tranlsation/ portfolio at [github.com/krzysiekwie](https://github.com/krzysiekwie "github.com/krzysiekwie")
